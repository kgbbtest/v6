The following are bugs or deficiencies in the OpenDKIM package that we
are aware of but which have not been fixed in the current release.  You
probably want to get the most up to date version of this from
http://www.opendkim.org.  For descriptions of bugs that
have been fixed, see the file RELEASE_NOTES.

This list is not guaranteed to be complete.  Check the OpenDKIM web site for
additional pending bugs and feature requests.


SIGNATURE HEADER TRUNCATION

The sendmail MTA caps the length of headers to prevent a known MIME
header attack.  Unfortunately this can interfere with processing of a
sufficiently large DKIM-Signature header.  If you are getting failures
on large signature headers which should otherwise be passing, consider
adjusting the value of the MaxMimeHeaderLength option to a larger value
(or to 0 which removes the limit).  See the sendmail MTA configuration
documentation for more information.
