.TH opendkim-genrates 8 "The Trusted Domain Project"
.SH NAME
.B opendkim-genrates
\- OpenDKIM recommended rate computation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendkim-genrates
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-genrates
collates data accumulated by the OpenDKIM statistics feature into daily
summaries that are then used to compute a recommended rate limit
for each signing domain.  It also generates a report of its findings,
which includes some specific (currently hard-coded) interesting domains.

The schemae that are used both as input (tables from which the values are
taken) and output (tables into which results are stored) can be found in
the
.I stats/mkdb.mysql
file in the OpenDKIM package.  The target tables are called "aggregate"
and "predictions".  This latter table can then be used by mail filtering
software to impose flow and spam ratio limits on a per-domain basis.

For a detailed description of the algorithms, see the white paper
"Enforcing Rate Limits Based on Authenticated Sender Reputation."

This work is experimental.
