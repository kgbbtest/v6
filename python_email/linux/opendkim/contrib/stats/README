This directory contains two files:

stats.lua -- sample Lua script for processing local enhancements to the
statistics reporting system (see the "stats" directory of the main package)

opendkim-fixipaddrs.pl -- perl script for removing duplicate entries from the
ipaddr table; if you were doing stats back when such a bug existed, you might
find this useful
