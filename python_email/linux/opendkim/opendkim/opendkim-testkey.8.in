.SH NAME
.B opendkim-testkey
\- DKIM filter installation test
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendkim-testkey
[\-d domain] [\-s selector] [\-k keypath] [\-v] [\-x configfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-testkey
verifies the setup of signing and verifying (private and public) keys for use
with
.I opendkim(8).

The test program will read a domain name and selector from the command
line, configuration file or a key table, then query and parse the resulting
DKIM key(s), reporting any errors found.

If a key path is also provided, the test program will read the private key
named and attempt to confirm that the private key specified by
.I keypath
(or in the key table)
and the public DKIM key retrieved match.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -d domain
Names the domain in which signing is to be done.  More specifically,
names the domain in which the public key matching the provided private key
will be found.  This parameter must be provided either explicitly, or in
the configuration file, or via a KeyTable (see
.I opendkim.conf(5)
for details).
.TP
.I -k keypath
Specifies the path to the private key file which should be used for this test.
This parameter is optional
.TP
.I -s selector
Names the selector within the specified domain whose public key should be
retrieved and tested, comparing it to the private key if provided.  This
parameter must be provided either explicitly, or in the configuration file,
or via a KeyTable (see
.I opendkim.conf(5)
for details).
.TP
.I -v
Increases the amount of output (verbosity) of the program.  May be specified
multiple times for increased output.
.TP
.I -x conffile
Names a configuration file to be parsed.  See the
.I opendkim.conf(5)
man page for details.  The only values used are Domain, Selector, KeyFile,
KeyTable, TrustAnchorFile and ResolverConfig.  The default is
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/opendkim.conf.
.SH NOTES
The test program will also complain if a private key file is readable
by anyone other than the user executing the program.
